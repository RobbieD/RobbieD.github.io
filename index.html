    <p> Here is where I will be posting updates on my final project for the class. </p>
    <p> As of yet (March 11, 2016), I do not have a concrete idea for the project,
      but am narrowing down my list of options.  I am thinking of either expolring
      Swift, the language for iOS, or an area of web programming with Clojure or Go.
      I aim to have a solid idea by the end of the weekend, and to be on my way
      shortly thereafter. </p>
